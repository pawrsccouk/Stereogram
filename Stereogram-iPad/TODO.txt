TODO for Stereogram


Store the images separately, instead of compositing them into one image. This allows...
    Add other stereogram types such as animated GIF or magic-eye / RDS.

Add the ability to crop on one image, and have the other image update to match it.
    Allow toggling between 'crop view' and 'result view' during this process.

Allow users to take a photo by clicking on the camera screen.
Separate the Take and Cancel button on the camera screen and make them more thumb-friendly.

Add polish:
    Create some welcome text to display for the WelcomeViewController.
    Create LaunchScreen.xib.
    Create new icons in all correct sizes.
    Look into builds and packaging options for App Store.
    Fiddle with the camera view and make sure it looks good in all sizes and orientations.
    Make a better crosshair, or a selection of them (+, X and T for example)
    What feedback does the app give that an editing operation is in process?
