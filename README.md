# Stereogram
## Summary
An iPad app designed to help the user take photos to be turned into stereograms.

## Usage
This application presents the user with a modified camera view including a crosshair.
* The user is prompted to centre the crosshair on a prominent landmark and then take one picture.
* The user is then prompted to take a pace to the right, keeping the crosshair on the landmark, and then take a second picture.
* The two pictures are then composited into a stereogram and the user can examine the image and switch between cross-eyed and wall-eyed viewing modes. 
* The stereogram is then stored and the user can review them and transfer the final image to the Camera Roll if so wished.

## Notes
This version is written for the iPad in Swift. I have another version Stereogram-iPhone which is written for older iPhones in Objective-C. In future, I intend to make this branch universal, but at the moment I don’t have an iOS8-capable iPhone so I can’t convert it.
